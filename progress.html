  <h1>Fireworks VS. Dreamweaver</h1>
    <p>I used two programs, Fireworks and Dreamweaver, to create a prototype for my storyboard.</p>
    <p>Here are the similarities and differences between the two programs.</p>
    <table border ="1px">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Similarities</b></td>
          <td>Differences in FW</td>
          <td>Differences in DW</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><ul>
              <li>Both programs are very visual-oriented. They give you an outlook of what your site can look like.</li>
              <li>Both are used fairly often for web design.</li>
              <li>Final files can be opened to a web browser to experience the website.</li>
            </ul></td>
            <td><ul>
              <li>FW is focused on production of Web graphics and the looks of the site rather than its usability.</li>
              <li>FW is very quick to use to create a big picture of the website. With it's splicing tool, you can determine which parts of the webpage are usable and which are not.</li>
              <li>The final FW file can be exported into an HTML and CSS code</li>
            </ul></td>
            <td><ul>
              <li>DW is focused more on the structure and the coding of webpages/websites.</li>
              <li>Provides a design mode where you can code and see what it looks like, so you get both ideas of what the code is and what the code looks like.</li>
            </ul></td>
