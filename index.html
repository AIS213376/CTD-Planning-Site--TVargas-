  <h1>Brainstorm</h1>
  <p>These are some ideas that I can use to propose my final idea. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ms. Abel's Literary Devices for AP Lang</li>
    <li>Ms. Chan's Recycling Club</li>
    <li>Journalism class</li>
    <li>Human Rights Club</li>
    <li>MUN Club</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Choosing</h1>
  <p>After brainstorming several ideas, I chose the MUN Club<p>
  <p>The MUN Club is a growing group and often many people waste too much time trying to make sense of what the club is actually about. The site will help the leaders and the members of the club connect with each other in a sufficient time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the chairs to effectively describe the process of what happens during an MUN Conference (Speech, Papers)</li>
    <li>To provide better explanation what the MUN Club is for</li>
    <li>To list several conferences members can join</li>
  <p>Client: MUN Chairs</p>
