  <h1>Fireworks VS. Dreamweaver</h1>
    <p>I used two programs, Fireworks and Dreamweaver, to create a prototype for my storyboard.</p>
    <p>Here are the similarities and differences between the two programs.</p>
    <table border ="1px">
      <tbody>
        <tr><b>
          <td>Similarities</td>
          <td>Differences in FW</td>
          <td>Differences in DW</td>
        </b></tr>
        <tr>
            <td><ul>
              <li>Both programs are very visual-oriented. They give you an outlook of what your site can look like.</li>
              <li>Both are used fairly often for web design.</li>
              <li>Final files can be opened to a web browser to experience the website.</li>
            </ul></td>
            <td><ul>
              <li>FW is focused on production of Web graphics and the looks of the site rather than its usability.</li>
              <li>FW is very quick to use to create a big picture of the website. With it's splicing tool, you can determine which parts of the webpage are usable and which are not.</li>
              <li>The final FW file can be exported into an HTML and CSS code</li>
            </ul></td>
            <td><ul>
              <li>DW is focused more on the structure and the coding of webpages/websites.</li>
              <li>Provides a design mode where you can code and see what it looks like, so you get both ideas of what the code is and what the code looks like.</li>
              <li>The canvas space is unlimited, so you can make any changes without being restricted
            </ul></td>

  <h2>Insights</h2>
  <h3>Dreamweaver</h3>
  <p>Overall, I enjoyed using Dreamweaver more. Although it is more complex to use, it does help me practice more CSS and HTML.</p>
  <p>In addition, Dreamweaver has multiple views that helped me understand different perspectives of my html file:
    <ul>
      <li>Design View: How the .html will look like</li>
      <li>Code View: What the .html code is</li>
      <li>Split view: Both the Design View and Code View</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Fireworks</h3>
  <p>However, I will use Fireworks before Dreamweaver to give a big idea of the .html file I will develop</p>
  <p>Fireworks is very effective in the sense that it's very easy to adjust pixel sizes such as boxes.</p>
  <p>It also provides a web layer that quickly organizes the .html file into interactive sections</p>
  <h1>The homepages I have made</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="htdocs/index-FW.htm">Fireworks Version</a></li>
    <li><a href="htdocs/index-DW.html">Dreamworks Version</a></li>
