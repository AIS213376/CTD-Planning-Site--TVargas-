  <h1>Brainstorm</h1>
  <p>These are some ideas that I can use to propose my final idea. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ms. Abel's Literary Devices for AP Lang</li>
    <li>Ms. Chan's Recycling Club</li>
    <li>Journalism class</li>
    <li>Human Rights Club</li>
    <li>MUN Club</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Choosing</h1>
  <p>After brainstorming several ideas, I chose the MUN Club<p>
  <p>The MUN Club is a growing group and often many people waste too much time trying to make sense of what the club is actually about. The site will help the leaders and the members of the club connect with each other in a sufficient time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the chairs to effectively describe the process of what happens during an MUN Conference (Speech, Papers)</li>
    <li>To provide better explanation what the MUN Club is for</li>
    <li>To list several conferences members can join</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Client: MUN Chairs</b></p>
  <h1>Grouping</h1>
  <p>I am in a group with Jacky and Archit.</p>
  <p><b>Project:</b> Elementary PE Website</p>
  <p><b>Brief:</b> Mr. Kalin, the elementary school PE teacher, has put together a website to support his classes. Due to time and skill limitations, Mr. Kalin requires someone with an eye for design and detail to help improve the layout and user experience of the site.</p>
  <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
  <ul>
  	<li>To improve the user experience of the current website</li>
  	<li>For parents and students to easily access supporting materials related to PE in elementary school</li>
  	<li>For parents to better understand PE in elementary school</li>
  	<li>For Mr. Kalin to easily update the site in the future</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Client:</b> Mr. Kalin</p>
  <p>The existing site is in <a href= "https://sites.google.com/a/ais.edu.hk/physical-education-health/">Google Sites</a></p>
