  <h1>Brainstorm</h1>
  <p>These are some ideas that I can use to propose my final idea. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ms. Abel's Literary Devices for AP Lang</li>
    <li>Ms. Chan's Recycling Club</li>
    <li>Journalism class</li>
    <li>Human Rights Club</li>
    <li>MUN Club</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Choosing</h1>
  <p>After brainstorming several ideas, I chose the MUN Club<p>
  <p>The MUN Club is a growing group and often many people waste too much time trying to make sense of what the club is actually about. The site will help the leaders and the members of the club connect with each other in a sufficient time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the chairs to effectively describe the process of what happens during an MUN Conference (Speech, Papers)</li>
    <li>To provide better explanation what the MUN Club is for</li>
    <li>To list several conferences members can join</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Client: MUN Chairs</b></p>
  <h1>Project - Elementary PE Website</h1>
  <p>I am in a group with Jacky and Archit.</p>
  <p><b>Project:</b> Elementary PE Website</p>
  <p><b>Brief:</b> Mr. Kalin, the elementary school PE teacher, has put together a website to support his classes. Due to time and skill limitations, Mr. Kalin requires someone with an eye for design and detail to help improve the layout and user experience of the site.</p>
  <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
  <ul>
  	<li>To improve the user experience of the current website</li>
  	<li>For parents and students to easily access supporting materials related to PE in elementary school</li>
  	<li>For parents to better understand PE in elementary school</li>
  	<li>For Mr. Kalin to easily update the site in the future</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Audience:</b>EC/ES students/teachers; some portion dedicated to parents</p>
  <p><b>Purpose:</b>teaching tool for students/teachers</p>
  <p><b>Client:</b> Mr. Kalin</p>
  <p>The existing site is in <a href= "https://sites.google.com/a/ais.edu.hk/physical-education-health/">Google Sites</a></p>

  <h1>Ideating</h1>
  <p>Here are some of my flowcharts:</p>
  <table border="1px">
  <tbody>
  	<tr>
  		<td>Flowchart</td>
  		<td>Thoughts</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
		<td><img src ="Flowcharts/Flowchart 1.png" alt="Flowchart 1" width=500px length=285px /></td>
  		<td>Although the flowchart is very simplistic, it gives a direct idea of what the big picture of the site would be. The client said that he liked the idea of adding a resource center for parents.</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td><img src ="Flowcharts/Flowchart 2.png" alt="Flowchart 2" width=500px length=285px /></td>
  		<td>This flowchart is a more narrow idea of what the site would contain. The homepage would mostly include an overview (slideshow) to Health Studies, PE Activities, and Current Events. These overviews will be linked to a more detailed explanation where the user can navigate and explore themselves.</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td><img src="Flowcharts/Flowchart 3.png" alt="Flowchart 3" width=500px length=285px /></td>
  		<td><p>Flowchart 1 and Flowchart 2 has been combined to create Flowchart 3. Flowchart 3 added the idea of resources for PE Activities. However, after consulting with Mr. Chiu, we realized that we needed a much more simplistic flowchart (this one is too complex) and it needed to appeal to the audience.</p>
  		<p>With that in mind, we had a second meeting with the client to discuss who the audience would be. After deducing that the clients would mostly be students and/or teachers, we created a fourth flowchart.</p></td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td><img src="Flowcharts/Flowchart 4.png" alt="Flowchart 4" width=500px length=285px /></td>
  		<td><p>This flowchart addresses the problem of separating the Elementary School from the Early Childhood. It also focuses more on the big idea of the website and removed junk pages.</p>
  		<p>This will be our <b>chosen</b> flowchart, as it does address the user experience of the website, resources available to students, teachers and parents, and general simplicity for the client to edit in the future.</td>
  	</tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Here is one wireframe that will be used to organize the homepage:</p>
  <table border="1px">
  <tbody>
  	<tr>
  		<td>Wireframes</td>
  		<td>Thoughts</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td><img src="PE - Wireframes/Homepage Wireframe 1.png" alt="Wireframe 1" width=400px length=500px /></td>
  		<td><p>The whole idea of this wireframe is to mimic the chosen flowchart. The first thing that will be seen is the banner header then the navigation buttons.</p>
  		<p>Then, the audience will pay attention to an announcement board, which is most likely the first thing that the audience </p></td>
  	</tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Later, the wireframe will be transformed into a storyboard, where it will show a rough outlook of what the site would be.</p>
  <table border="1px">

  		<td>Storyboard</td>
  		<td>Thoughts</td>
